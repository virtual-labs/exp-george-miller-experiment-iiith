## Procedure
1) Present participants with a series of random words (e.g., dog, chair, apple, car, book) in a sequential manner on the screen.
2) Participants are instructed to remember the presented words in the correct order.
3) Start with a shorter word span (e.g., 3 words) and gradually increase the span in subsequent trials (e.g., 3,4,5 words).
4) Participants should enter the words they remember in the exact order they were presented.
5) Repeat each word span multiple times to obtain reliable results.
6) Collect response data, including the number of correctly recalled words for each word span.
